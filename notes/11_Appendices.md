### **11.1 Selector Cheat Sheet**

Selectors are the foundation of reliable Playwright automation. Using robust selectors minimizes flakiness and improves test maintainability.

| Selector Type            | Usage                    | Example                                        | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Text selector**        | Locate by visible text   | `page.getByText('Submit')`                     | Case-insensitive by default           |
| **Role selector**        | Accessibility-based      | `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })` | Preferred over CSS for resilience     |
| **Label selector**       | Form fields              | `page.getByLabel('Username')`                  | Works for input, textarea, select     |
| **Placeholder selector** | Input placeholder        | `page.getByPlaceholder('Search...')`           | Good for dynamic inputs               |
| **Chaining locators**    | Narrow selection         | `page.locator('.list').locator('li').first()`  | Reduces ambiguity                     |
| **Nth locator**          | Specific element in list | `page.locator('.card').nth(2)`                 | Zero-based index                      |
| **Filter locators**      | Attribute or text filter | `locator.filter({ hasText: 'Active' })`        | Combine with chaining for precision   |
| **CSS selector**         | Standard CSS             | `page.locator('.btn.primary')`                 | Avoid brittle, use as fallback        |
| **XPath selector**       | Advanced DOM path        | `page.locator('//button[text()="Submit"]')`    | Less preferred, use only if necessary |

**Best Practices**

* Prefer **getByRole/getByText/getByLabel** for resilience.
* Avoid overly specific CSS selectors tied to implementation details.
* Use **chaining** to reduce ambiguity in large DOMs.

### **11.2 Configuration Reference (`playwright.config.ts`)**

Playwright configuration allows you to control **parallelism, retries, browsers, and reporting**.

**Example Full Configuration**

```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 30_000,
  expect: { timeout: 5000 },
  retries: 2,
  reporter: [['list'], ['html', { open: 'on-failure' }]],
  use: {
    headless: true,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
    actionTimeout: 5000,
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure'
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'Chromium', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },
    { name: 'Firefox', use: { browserName: 'firefox' } },
    { name: 'WebKit', use: { browserName: 'webkit' } },
    { name: 'Mobile Safari', use: { ...devices['iPhone 14'] } }
  ],
  workers: 4
});
```

**Key Options**

* `testDir`: Directory containing test files.
* `timeout`: Maximum time per test.
* `retries`: Retry failed tests.
* `reporter`: Output formats (list, html, json, allure).
* `use`: Global test options (headless, viewport, trace, video, etc.).
* `projects`: Cross-browser testing configuration.
* `workers`: Number of parallel test workers.

**Best Practices**

* Isolate projects for cross-browser tests.
* Enable **tracing and video** for CI to debug failures.
* Use `retries` sparingly; fix root causes for flaky tests.

### **11.3 Comparison with Other Tools**

| Feature                  | Playwright                 | Selenium                      | Cypress                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Browser Support**      | Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  | Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari | Chromium only             |
| **Language Support**     | JS/TS, Python, Java, .NET  | Java, Python, C#, JS          | JS/TS only                |
| **Auto-waiting**         | Yes, built-in              | No                            | Partial (Cypress retries) |
| **Parallelism**          | Yes, built-in              | Requires setup                | Limited                   |
| **Headless/Headed**      | Both                       | Both                          | Both                      |
| **Mobile Emulation**     | Yes, full device emulation | Limited                       | Limited                   |
| **API Mocking**          | Yes                        | Limited                       | Yes                       |
| **Component Testing**    | Supported                  | Not native                    | Supported (experimental)  |
| **Network Interception** | Full support               | Limited                       | Partial                   |
| **Flakiness**            | Low with proper locators   | High                          | Moderate                  |
| **CI/CD Integration**    | Easy                       | Easy                          | Easy                      |

**Summary:**

* **Playwright** is preferred for modern web apps, cross-browser and multi-language support, and advanced automation.
* **Selenium** is more legacy and language-diverse but less modern in features.
* **Cypress** is excellent for fast front-end JS projects but limited in browser diversity and language support.

### **11.4 Migration Guide**

**Migrating from Selenium to Playwright**

1. Replace WebDriver commands with **Playwright locators and actions**.
2. Convert waits to **auto-waiting locators** instead of `Thread.sleep` or `time.sleep`.
3. Replace Selenium’s `driver.switchTo` with **Playwright context/page handling**.
4. Update **browser setup** using `chromium.launch()`, `firefox.launch()`, or `webkit.launch()`.

**Migrating from Cypress to Playwright**

1. Convert **Cypress `cy` commands** to Playwright `page` methods.
2. Replace Cypress-specific assertions (`should`) with **Playwright `expect`**.
3. Update network stubs to Playwright’s **`page.route()`**.
4. Map Cypress retries and timeouts to **Playwright config** options.

**Best Practices for Migration**

* Migrate tests incrementally rather than all at once.
* Use **Playwright Inspector** to debug migrated tests.
* Introduce **projects** for cross-browser verification during migration.

### **11.5 Additional Reference**

**Useful Shortcuts**

* `page.pause()` – Pause test and open inspector.
* `locator.first()` / `locator.nth()` – Target specific element.
* `expect(locator).toHaveText()` – Wait for text.
* `page.screenshot()` – Capture screenshot.
* `page.video()` – Capture video.
* `page.tracing.start()` / `stop()` – Record trace for debugging.
